Notes HW7:
Main focus was on getting parsing to work properly. We generally acheived our goals.
We put a lot of effort into the "what", "why", and "where" categories, using constituency and dependency parses where we could.
We have rudementary systems for the "who" and "yes/no" categories.
We have yet to implement "when" and "how" categories.
We spent a lot of time figuring out the dependecy and constituency parses so the missing cateogories should go faster during the next round
We also spent a lot of time doing word_embeddings, Katelyn specifically, but we didn't end up using it.
We also tightened up sentence selection and get pretty good recall.
