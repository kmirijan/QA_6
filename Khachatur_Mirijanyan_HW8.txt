Tasks:
Improved Sentence Selection
Improved "What", "Where", "Why" categories
Tried word_embeddings
Created group specific score-answers. Not turned in since it was part of the qa_engine. Meant for debugging

Khachatur Contribution:
Improved sentence selection and implemented "Where" questions
Sentence Selection:
Put extra emphasis on sentence roots and nsubj through the d-parse when using the bag of words method
Did a lot of cleanup of word stemming so that words that are meant to match do so
"Where" Questions:
Fully uses the dependency parse to get the necessary peice of sentence.
Specifically targeted the "nmod" relation to find matches between candidate sentences and questions and where to start parsing
Tries to then get the rest of the answer with the most relevant relations
If the dependency parse can't be used, the it falls back to using a chunker.
