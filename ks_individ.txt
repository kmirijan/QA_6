Katelyn
Katelyn continued to work on "why" questions. She went through all the ones where we were recieving the correct sentence and was able to get most of them besides questions where we noted there were inconsistencies. She looked at the relationship between the main verb in the question and the words of the setences to try and figure out when synonyms were used. She used the wordnet that Khachatur implemented and noticed that not all the stories were being added. She spent a long time debugging this and ended up emailing the TA about it. She then worked on the "what" questions, specifically "what + verb", and used chunking for this. She adjusted the regex and worked to find a noun phrase that ended in the verb phrase so she could check if the question main verb was in the verb phrase, where she could then look for the noun, where that would be the answer. This worked except it caused a loss in Recall, because she could not capture the word "the" as part of the answer. We did not implement her code since our F-measure was better without it.
